# Ouroboros
Introverted NNs, inspired by meta learning techniques, and NN architectures including NN Quines, Introspective NNs, Hypernetworks, and self-referential weight matrices.

# Paper
We have an annotated bibliography in progress ([Link to LaTeX document on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mkyktsvwsjqh)) as part of our literature review efforts.

## About The Project
### Built With
Several specialty libraries are used. A list of all packages and their version can be found in the config/envs directory.
### Code Style
Docstrings, typehints, and comments brought to you in [Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
### Directory Structure
Directory structure mimics conventional PyTorch projects. A full dated summary can be found in directory_tree.txt.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
### Installation
### Environment Setup
### Container Setup
Docker containers for running the project are on the roadmap!

## Usage
The core component of usage is the training pipeline. The tuning pipeline, parallelization pipeline, and all others inherit from the Trainer superclass.
### Demo
### Tuning
### Parallelizing

## Roadmap

## Contributing
Currently we have a couple branches for making changes and contributions.
New branches can be created if the process of achieving the desired outcome risks breaking the existing copy of the codebase on main.

## License

## Contact
The core contributors are reachable by email, Twitter, and most other means.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Kevin for being a reliable partner, and a close friend.
